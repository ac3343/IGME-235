            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>For this project, I worked on creating a solid game concept before beginning to code. The sumo idea was one I actually had while sitting in class, although I hadn't planned on using it for this project. Combining fantasy with classical japanese art feels unique to me; however, I fear I lack the artistic skill to fully realize the concept. I made a mock up image using some images from the internet to convey how the game would be set up. After I decided what my game would be, I finished the game treatment and began work on the actual website. I created the HTML files with a basic structure, and began work on the style sheet. That took priority since I knew it would need the most time and tinkering. Using an online color scheme generator, I picked a color scheme that would fit the traditional japanese artstyle, though I feel it doesn't convey the mystic side of the project enough. Once I was done with the style sheet, I finished up the proposal, index, and documentation files.</p>
